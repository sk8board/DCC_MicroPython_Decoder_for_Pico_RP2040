# RP2040 DMA Chain Example with PIO
# 
# 1) For loop will feed state machine 0 one bit at a time.
# 2) State machine 0 will pass the bit from TX FIFO to RX FIFO then autopush will trigger DMA 0 or DMA 1
# 3) DMA 0 and DMA 1 will move the bit from state machine 0 TX FIFO to state machine 1 RX FIFO
#    Note: DMA 0 and DMA 1 are "chained" together, which means after DMA 0 completes the transfer, 
#    then DMA 0 will triggers DMA 1, then DMA 1 will do the same to DMA 0 after completion
#    of data transfer, the RP2040 datasheet calls this "ping-pong" DMA transfer.
# 4) State machine 1 will accumulate 32 bits then autopush will trigger DMA 2 or DMA 3
# 5) DMA 2 and DMA 3 will move the bit from state machine 1 TX FIFO to the address of "output_data".
#    DMA 2 and DMA 3 are chained together and perform "ping-pong" like DMA 0 and DMA 1.
